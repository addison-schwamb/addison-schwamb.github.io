<p>Hi, I’m Addison. I am an electrical engineer by training who develops dynamical systems models of the brain for use in clinical neuroscience. I am currently pursuing my PhD at Washington University in Saint Louis, under the advisement of Dr. ShiNung Ching. You can see more of my work in the paper highlights on the <a href="/">main page</a>, or in my CV below. Are you a current graduate student, or considering graduate school? Check out the <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page for some of the helpful resources I’ve used during my PhD.</p>
