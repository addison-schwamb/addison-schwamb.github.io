### General FAQs
I compiled a long list of questions I asked myself throughout grad school, which you can view [here](/faq/)

### Paper Reading
"Why You Hate Literature Review and 7 Ways to Fix It" by Thomas Deetjen at [Productive Academic](https://www.productiveacademic.com/articles/research-process/literature-review)

I've used multiple note taking softwares for compiling my research & literature notes over the years but I currently use [Notesnook](https://notesnook.com/) since it's open source. I also really like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

### Figures
I make all of my figures in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
